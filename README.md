# Quandl-Test
An example app to get data from Quandl.

To run it, the API key must be updated in the server/settings.json file (use the settings-example.json file as an example).
Also, you need to change the database code you will be using, which will be "WIKI" by default, as well as the name of the .csv file you will be using to get the dataset names from.

To run the server with the selected setting, start meteor with the command

*meteor run --settings server/settings.json*
